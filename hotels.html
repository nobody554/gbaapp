<center><h1>Hotel Partners</h1></center><br>

<p>GBA has partnered with 5 local hotels to offer alumni and families an opportunity to book discounted hotel rooms.</p><br />
<p>GBA has blocked a limited number of discounted rooms at Radisson, Staybridge Suites, Embassy Suites, Holiday Inn - Civic Center, and Best Western - Lubbock Windsor. These rooms will be reserved on a first come basis and you will be responsible for all reservations/cancellations/hotel requirements, etc. GBA has only secured the reduced rate - each individual party will be responsible for their own arrangements/payments, etc.</p><br />
<p>Please review the information on the GBA website for additional details and requirements for each hotel. Remember, ABD is on a holiday weekend so rates have been increased and hotels will fill up quickly. There are only a limited number of reserved rooms at each hotel below so reserve before the first week in August.</p><br />
<p><strong>Breakfast: </strong>The Radisson Hotel is giving a special breakfast buffet discount of $8.95 per person, just mention you are with the Tech Goin' Band. You do not have to stay at the Radisson to receive the discounted breakfast.</p><br />
